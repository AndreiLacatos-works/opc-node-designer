# Manage transition points

A transition point can be added at any position within the duration range, provided it aligns with the ticks (defined by the frequency). When a new transition point is added, all subsequent transition edges are flipped — rising edges become falling edges and vice versa. The same effect occurs when a transition point is removed.
