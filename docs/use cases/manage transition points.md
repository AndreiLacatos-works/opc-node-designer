# Manage transition points

## For Boolean nodes

A transition point can be added at any position within the duration range, provided it aligns with the ticks (defined by the frequency). When a new transition point is added, all subsequent transition edges are flipped â€” rising edges become falling edges and vice versa. The same effect occurs when a transition point is removed.

## For Numeric nodes

A transition point can be added at any position within the duration range, provided it aligns with the ticks (defined by the frequency). The value for a transition point must be provided, it defaults to 0. When adding a point by clicking the plot, the value is computed from the position of the cursor.

Value of the tick(s) between the data points are defined by the smoothing behavior. 3 strategies are supported:

- steps
- linear interpolation
- cubic spline

Step strategy does not apply any smoothing, it holds the value until the next data point. Linear strategy takes into account the number of intermediary ticks and the delta between the two values; it simulates a linear stransition. The cubic spline strategy uses a cubic spline polynomial expression to provide smooth transitions.
